    <h1>A Comparison of Unemployment Rate Trends from August 2022 to August 2023</h1>
    <h3>By Lilly Roser</h3>
    <p>The state of Maryland gained 12,400 jobs in August, becoming the third fastest growing job market in the nation, data released by state labor officials shows. 
According to the Monthly Labor Review’s survey data from the Maryland Department of Labor for the month of August, the state showed the largest job growth since July of last year. 
More specifically, for Prince George’s County, the labor review also showed unemployment rates are declining. </p>
<p>
The unemployment rate for the county stood at 1.9% this August, nearly half of what it was a year ago. 
    </p>
<p>The data also revealed that Prince George’s County, being the second most populated county in the state, has seen the lowest unemployment rates over the past three months than it has in a year. 
    </p>
<p>Additionally, a press release from the Maryland State Department of Labor mentioned the areas of business that experienced the most and least job growth in the state. While the professional and business services sector experienced the most growth, other sectors like trade, transportation, utilities and financial activities experienced a decline. 
The data also revealed national statistics. Since July of 2022, unlike the state of Maryland, the overall unemployment rate has increased in the United States. 
The press release showed “this is the seventh consecutive month of record-setting low unemployment for Maryland.” 
    </p>
<p>"We are harnessing our untapped potential and building pathways in the growth sectors by bringing work, wages and wealth to every single Marylander," Gov. Wes Moore said during his periodic "More from Moore" speech on YouTube.
