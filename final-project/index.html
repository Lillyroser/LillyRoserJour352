			<p>Gary LaFree was hiking in Nepal with his son when he received an unexpected phone call. He initially thought it was a prank.</p>
			<p>“It was sort of surreal,” LaFree said. “We were way the heck up in the mountains and I thought ‘this must be a prank call from Stockholm.’ But it turned out to be real.”</p>
			<p>The phone call notified the University of Maryland criminology and criminal justice professor that he was selected to receive the 2024 Stockholm Prize in Criminology — the world’s most prestigious criminology award. The selection was officially announced on Nov. 6.</p>
			<p>The Stockholm Prize is awarded to “outstanding achievements in criminological research” or research that aids in crime reduction, according to Stockholm University in Sweden.</p>
			<p>For LaFree, the award is a “book-end” to a long career in criminology.</p>
			<p>“In the back of my mind, I had certainly hoped to win it at some point,” LaFree said. “But I figured the odds were pretty long.”</p>
			<p>LaFree, who studies criminology on a group level basis through a sociology lens, will share the award with Tom Tyler, a law and psychology professor at Yale Law School whose work is focused more on the individual level basis through a psychology lens. The pair will receive a monetary prize of more than $95,000.</p>
			<p>LaFree is the third faculty member from this university to win the Stockholm Prize since the award’s inception in 2006.</p>
			<p>After focusing on criminology for his graduate and professional career, LaFree said that it feels “really good” to be recognized for his work .</p>

			<p>However, LaFree is not the only one who celebrated his award. Brandon Behlendorf, a doctoral alum of this university and mentee of LaFree’s, said that when he found out about the award, he stood up, thumped his table and cheered, “‘That's awesome!’”</p>
			<p>Behlendorf, who is now an assistant professor for the emergency preparedness, homeland security and cybersecurity college at the State University of New York at Albany, said he would not be where he is today without LaFree’s “mentorship and guidance.”</p>

			<p>While LaFree’s graduate and career journey has been criminology focused, LaFree was a history major for his undergraduate years of college. Behlendorf said that LaFree’s ability to contextualize research is an important asset.</p>
			<p>Behlendorf said that “one of the things that Dr. LaFree does quite often in his work is he doesn't just look at … the current context of the problem he's engaged with. [LaFree] also says, ‘what have thought leaders and thinkers in the past said about this?’”</p>
			<p>LaFree emphasized that history intersects with his criminology work because he has always been interested in longitudinal trends, historical explanations for how things change over time and archival data.</p>
			<p>In the past, he has investigated homicides, how legitimacy influences international violence levels and understanding terrorism through a criminological lens.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of survey data that he has published to help others better undersand U.S. attitudes towards terrorism:</p>

			<p>According to LaFree, these survey results show that "about one-quarter of those who reported thinking about terrorism said it made them extremely or very worried, which is about the same fraction who said thinking about hospitalization made them extremely or very worried (27 percent.)"</p>
			<p>It is also important to note that the survey size for the first pie chart was 228 people. The survey size for the second was 147 people.</p>
			<p>Several of LaFree’s former colleagues and students emphasized his expertise and contributions in his field.</p>
			<p>Yesenia Yanez, a research assistant for LaFree and a doctoral criminology and criminal justice student at this university, said LaFree “knows everything” there is about terrorism and criminology. Yanez said her work focuses on mass shootings. She said she appreciates that LaFree allows her to explore her personal curiosities alongside the terrorism research the pair performs together.</p>
			<p>According to Yanez, LaFree has invited her to sit in on some of his undergraduate classes. He “[takes] the initiative to say, ‘Hey, this is important for you to learn, come learn this.’”LaFree has helped her see parts of academia she would not have had the opportunity to engage with otherwise, Yanez added.</p>
			<p>However, Yanez is not the only person to say that LaFree is passionate about helping others explore their own curiosities.</p>
			<p>Danielle Saman, an alum of this university and LaFree’s former teaching assistant, pointed out this same character trait when reflecting on a meeting she had with LaFree after a semester of being his teaching assistant.</p>
			<p>“I remember him really taking an interest in my future educational path even if that was different from his,” Saman, who now attends law school at George Mason University, said. “It just showed how passionate he was in trying to help students no matter what endeavor they decide to take in the future,” she added.</p>
			<p>Saman said that her current national security law interests stem from her previous work with LaFree.</p>

		<p class="quote"><span class="quotemark">&#8220;</span>When there’s a kind of an attack on legitimacy, when people don’t feel the rules are fair, when they don’t trust the law, you will often get an increase in bad behavior and crime.”</p>

			<p>LaFree has engaged in a wide range of criminology-related work, but his research about legitimacy — a population’s trust and belief in a ruling authority — is what led him to receive the Stockholm Prize.</p>
			<p>“When there’s a kind of an attack on legitimacy, when people don’t feel the rules are fair, when they don’t trust the law, you will often get an increase in bad behavior and crime,” he said.</p>
			<p>This concept can be seen from the Black Lives Matter and “defund the police” movements. LaFree said these movements fueled by a lack of legitimacy coincided with an increase in violence and crime.</p>
			<p>To LaFree, a public sense of legitimacy and lower crime rates tend to be greater when the country is engaged in globalization. This includes human interaction, a more open society, more international commerce, travel, immigration and more trade partners.</p>
			<p>While globalization has ultimately increased since World War Two, LaFree said he hopes the world is not returning, post-COVID-19, to a more isolationist, defensive, “my country first attitude.”</p>
			<p>In his opinion, globalization is a major reason for women’s rights, minority rights and educational attainment.</p>
			<p>LaFree also said that the recent developments in Israel and Palestine give a current example of a battle over legitimacy, as both regions are trying to influence individuals to disagree with the legitimacy of the other. With this, he says, comes an increase in crime.</p>

			<p>LaFree is holding out hope for the future of society.</p>
			<p>“Every group of students coming through always thinks they're unique. But I think [current students] really are unique,” LaFree said. He added that the current generation will determine not just the future of the United States, but the future of the world.</p>
			<p>LaFree’s optimistic outlook is no surprise to Behlendorf. Behlendorf emphasized that LaFree has been a positive figure since they first met.</p>
			<p>When Behlendorf and his wife were deciding on whether or not they would move to Maryland so that he could attend the University of Maryland for his Ph.D. program in 2007, they paid a visit to the campus. Behlendorf mentioned that their last meeting of the day was with Dr. LaFree, who went on to be Behlendorf’s advisor at the university.</p>
			<p>Behlendorf acknowledged that a candidate, like himself, bringing a spouse to this initial meeting and campus visit was not a standard practice. Regardless, he added that moving to Maryland to receive a Ph.D. was a sacrifice his wife had to make, too.</p>
			<p>Behlendorf said that it was refreshing to have LaFree show interest in them both.</p>
			<p>“[After the meeting, my wife] said, ‘if everybody is as nice as Dr. LaFree was, we can make the move’,” Behlendorf said.</p>
			<p>To Behlendorf, LaFree has set a “wonderful” example of how to counter the “toxicity” that is normally seen in academia. LaFree has demonstrated that a professional can “succeed” and still value their family, he added.</p>
			<p>“In every interaction, [he is] somebody who is thoughtful, nice, respected, and somebody who cares enough to listen to folks intently and not just tell them what they need to do,” Behlendorf said.</p>
			<p>With the monetary portion of the prize, LaFree says the first thing he will do is pay for his family to stay in Stockholm to attend the award ceremony.</p>
			<p>LaFree being awarded the Stockholm Prize is “so well deserved,” said Saman.</p>
			<p>Saman also mentioned that LaFree is always trying to keep his students engaged, noting that LaFree would still email her the things he was implementing in his classes even after she graduated.</p>
			<p>He is “one of the best mentors” Saman has ever had, she said.</p>
